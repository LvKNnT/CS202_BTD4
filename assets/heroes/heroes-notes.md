# Heroes

My idea is let hero be used as an active useful spell. 

Instead of directly battling on the field, they can support the on-field monkeys with their unique passive. Each heros also has 2 active ability: minor can buff small group of monkey or help destroy some bloons and major can help all the mokey or destroy enormous amount of bloons.
